# Tello Wrapper

## Disclaimer
You will experience errors when running the example. There is nothing wrong with the code, you just need to wait a few seconds. The errors are h264 decode errors and they occur because a full frame hasn't been sent through by the drone yet.

## What is this?
This project is a wrapper around the SDK for the Tello drone. Which I am using for my projects

## Credits
This project is heavily inspired by the Tello wrapper that Jabrils' used in his TelloTV project (https://github.com/Jabrils/TelloTV). Which he got from Damià Fuentes Escoté (https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy)

In order to gather keypresses I used a getch() style function which came from: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2394609
